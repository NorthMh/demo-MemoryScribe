Another late night working on the Johnson account. I'm exhausted. This project is pushing me to my limits. Today, I tried taking short breaks every hour - a quick walk or some stretches. Surprisingly, it helped! I felt more focused and got more done than yesterday.

Note to self: Keep this up. Maybe set reminders to take breaks?

Despite the stress, I'm proud of the work I'm doing. The client seems happy with the progress. Just need to remember to breathe and take care of myself. This too shall pass.

Bedtime now. Tomorrow's another day.
