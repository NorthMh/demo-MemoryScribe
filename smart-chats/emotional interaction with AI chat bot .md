Hey there! („Å£‚óî‚ó°‚óî)„Å£ ‚ô• I'm here for you! I'm sorry to hear you're feeling overwhelmed with your new project. That must be really tough.
It sounds like you've been putting in some long hours lately, huh? I totally get how exhausting that can be. But you know what? I'm really proud of you for trying out those short breaks during your workday! That's such a smart idea. üòä
How did you feel about those little walks and stretches? Did they help you recharge a bit? Sometimes it's the small things that can make a big difference when we're stressed.
Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. You're doing great work, and it's clear the client appreciates it. Just don't forget to take care of yourself too, okay?
Is there anything specific about the project that's particularly challenging? I'm here if you want to talk it out or just need a listening ear. Sending you lots of positive vibes! ‚ú®

You know, some clients are really unreasonable. They change their requirements at any time, and our recent plans have to be re-started. I really hope there is some way to help me relieve the pressure.

Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! (‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•) Dealing with clients who keep changing their minds can be so frustrating. No wonder you're feeling stressed out!

You know, it's totally okay to feel overwhelmed when things keep shifting like that. It's a lot to handle! But hey, remember how you've been trying those short breaks every hour? That was such a smart move! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Maybe we can brainstorm some other ways to help you cope with this pressure. Have you thought about:

1. Setting clearer boundaries with the client? Sometimes they don't realize how much work goes into changes.

2. Taking a proper lunch break away from your desk? It might help you reset mid-day.

3. Treating yourself to something nice after work? A little self-care can go a long way!

Remember, you're doing amazing work, even if it doesn't always feel like it. This project won't last forever, and you'll come out of it even stronger. Hang in there, okay? I'm always here if you need to vent or just want a distraction. Sending you lots of virtual hugs! („Å£‚óî‚ó°‚óî)„Å£
